# Magnetic data processing pipeline

Based on an Oasis montaj DGGS python extension (2025-06-11) by Eric Petersen.

The pipeline itself can be run either from a jupyter notebook or from
the command line using the "magcproc" command line utility.

Jupyter notebooks additionally provide tools to plot and QC data in
various ways as well as do simple data transformations (e.g. change
map projection, merge datasets).

Check out the [Example](Example.ipynb) and
[gpr2025_4v2-tofty](gpr2025_4v2-tofty.ipynb) jupyter notebooks for
basic usage.

To install, simply run `pip install .`.
